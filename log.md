# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 20th, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Worked on exercises on Free Code Camp for HTML5.

**Thoughts:** At first it seemed simple because it were exercise I had already done, until I arrived to buttons, and actions to make checkboxes and radio(couldn't understand what radio was and had to search online to understand) I think I'm getting the hang of the radio and checkboxes. So far I have done 26 out of 1408 exercises on Free Code Camp

### Day 2: June 26th,2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on exercises of Free Code Camp for HTML5

**Thoughts**: I struggled for a bit with the definition of classes and also when I added a Google Font I was not doing it correctly, although the software didn't showed me what I was doing wrong, I know ussually in real coding the software will not tell me what I'm doing wrong but I liked that about code academy, I think I will do both Code academy and Free Code Camp.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
