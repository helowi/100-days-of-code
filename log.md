**Today's Progress**: Worked on exercises on Free Code Camp for HTML5.

**Thoughts:** At first it seemed simple because it were exercise I had already done, until I arrived to buttons, and actions to make checkboxes and radio(couldn't understand what radio was and had to search online to understand) I think I'm getting the hang of the radio and checkboxes. So far I have done 26 out of 1408 exercises on Free Code Camp

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
